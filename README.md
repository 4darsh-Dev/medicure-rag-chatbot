## Technologies Used
1. Streamlit- WebApp UI
2. Pinecone - Vector Database
3. Langchain and sentence-transformers - RetrieveQAChain and Embedding Model
4. Meta Llama-2-7b-chat quantized Model - Large Language Model(LLM) from Hugging Face Hub


## Solution Approach
Pinecone vector db stores the text_chunks embeddings generated from the Book Pdf. LangChain is used for building the LLMChain with promptTemplate to perform the similarity search from pinecone and then fine-grain the output with LLM.
